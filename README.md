# Heart-Disease-Detection
## IDEA
Heart disease is the leading cause of death globally, and its prevalence is
increasing rapidly. Early detection and prevention of heart disease are crucial for
reducing mortality rates and improving the quality of life for patients. We suggest a big data project that aims to develop a predictive model for the early
detection of heart disease.
