# Heart-Disease-Detection
## IDEA
Heart disease is the leading cause of death globally, and its prevalence is
increasing rapidly. Early detection and prevention of heart disease are crucial for
reducing mortality rates and improving the quality of life for patients. We suggest a big data project that aims to develop a predictive model for the early
detection of heart disease.

### Data preprocessing
- Every categorical class changed to numerical.
  - change columns that contain values of Yes / No with 0 / 1.
  - change sex column that contain Male / Female with 1 / 0.
  - convert Age Category, Race, Diabetic and GenHealth columns with increasing values.
- Check If non-values exist and delete it.

### Extracting insights from data
 - Male have slightly more diabetes the female.
 - Female are smoking less than Male.
 - BMI average is between 20 and 40 and there are many outliers.
 - Between 5 and 8 hours sleep time there are outliers.
